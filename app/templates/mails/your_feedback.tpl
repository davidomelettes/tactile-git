Hi {$firstname},

Many thanks for signing up to Tactile CRM and taking a look around.

I hope you like what you've seen so far. The team and I put all of our
effort into making Tactile CRM the best contact and sales management
tool for smaller businesses, nothing makes us happier than seeing
other people use it.

If Tactile CRM didn't really grab you, I'd love to know why so we can
right the wrongs. Just reply to this email and let me know - the good,
the bad, and the ugly - I make sure to read all the feedback we receive
and act upon as much of it as possible.

Forgotten your login details? You personal Tactile CRM site is at:
http://{$site_address}.tactilecrm.com and your username is '{$username}'.

Thanks for taking the time to look at Tactile CRM and to read this email.
