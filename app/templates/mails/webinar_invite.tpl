Hi {$firstname},

I trust you are getting on well with Tactile CRM and it's proving useful.

I just wanted to let you know that we have several of our free
'webinars' coming up and to offer you the chance to come along and ask
us any questions you have about Tactile CRM. They run on a regular
basis and we've got some coming up on:

* {$webinar1}
* {$webinar2}
* {$webinar3}

If those aren't convenient, keep an eye on the webinars page at
http://www.tactilecrm.com/webinars, drop me an email to george@tactilecrm.com,
or give us a call on +44(0)207 183 6677 (remember we're in the UK so between
9am and 5pm is best).
